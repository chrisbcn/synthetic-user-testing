# Synthetic User Testing Platform - Design Requirements Document

## Product Overview

A sophisticated platform for conducting AI-powered user interviews with synthetic personas, enabling teams to gather user insights without recruiting real participants. The platform allows researchers to create detailed user personas, conduct realistic interviews, and generate video testimonials from the conversations.

## Design Principles

### Visual Identity
- **Clean & Professional**: Modern, minimalist interface that builds trust
- **Warm & Approachable**: Avoid harsh lighting, use warm tones over cool blues
- **Elegant Simplicity**: Reduce cognitive load, prioritize essential information
- **Data-Driven**: Clear visualization of insights and metrics

### Color Palette
- **Primary**: Warm blues and teals for trust and professionalism
- **Accent**: Warm amber/gold for highlights and success states
- **Neutrals**: Cream, warm grays, and soft whites
- **Avoid**: Cool blues, harsh strip lighting effects, overly bright colors
